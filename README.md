# PlayingWithTitanic
Turning the famous Titanic dataset into a sandbox and playground for coding and machine learning.

I'm a big fan of learning with visualization, and that's hard to do without a topic that lends itself well to such visuals.  In this case, visualization is less about graphs and charts and more about a situation (context) that we can easily make sense of every feature, data point, binning result, etc. 

That's why I've now spent 3 months playing with the Titanic dataset. No, it hasn't taken that long to get a prediction; I had that in a matter of a day.

Rather, I've used this dataset as a sandbox - or dare I say, a playground - for data science and analysis skills. Every time I want to play with a library or algorithm, I come back to the Titanic.

But why?

Because I know what to expect. Making age bins is logical and I can play with the code and tools to do it until I feel comfortable.  Then, I'm off to apply it to whatever other project I have. Often, the data in those projects is so massive and so complex that it might be hard to evaluate results of binning to determine whether there's a code error or not. 

Plus, it's fun. If someone really wants to, they can go out and get the official Titanic survivor list and get a perfect score on their prediction. So, the goal isn't to succeed, it's to learn. And the best competitors value learning above all else.

So, thanks for visiting, thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy!
